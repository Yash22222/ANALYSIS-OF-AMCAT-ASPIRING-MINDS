First, the average salary for computer and other engineering graduates in specific roles such as Senior Quality Engineer is 460,000 LPA This finding highlights the income of new graduates in engineering can get emphasized and is a criterion for wage expectations.

Furthermore, the study revealed interesting patterns of gender preference. Although further research is needed, preliminary findings suggest that there may be differences in key options for men and women. 
Understanding these differences can inform targeted initiatives to promote diversity and inclusion in the technology workforce.

Moving forward, several interesting research questions emerge from the study. Examining the effects of specialization on wages, local differences in employment opportunities, 
and the effects of college status on employment trajectories can provide deeper insights into the factors affecting employment outcomes that they of the completed technology acquisition. Additionally, gender research differences in wage negotiations, career development trajectories over time, 
and the effects of personality traits on career success may shed light on important areas a technological advances must be made.

Overall, this study serves as a starting point for further research and analysis to understand the dynamics of engineering graduate employment outcomes. 
By addressing these research questions, stakeholders can make informed decisions to enhance career prospects and promote equal opportunities in technology.
