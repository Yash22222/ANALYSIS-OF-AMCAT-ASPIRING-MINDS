Step - 1 - Introduction -> Giving a detailed data description and objective
Step - 2 - Importing the data and display the head, shape and description of the data.
Step - 3 - Univariate Analysis -> PDF, Histograms, Boxplots, Countplots, etc..
           Find the outliers in each numerical column
           Understanding the probability and frequency distribution of each numerical column
           Understanding the frequency distribution of each categorical Variable/Column
           Mentioning observations after each plot.
Step - 4 - Bivariate Analysis
          Discovering the relationships between numerical columns using Scatter plots, hexbin plots, pair plots, etc..
          Identifing the patterns between categorical and numerical columns using swarmplot, boxplot, barplot, etc..
          Identifing relationships between categorical and categorical columns using stacked bar plots.
          Mentioning observations after each plot.
Step - 5 - Research Questions
          Times of India article dated Jan 18, 2019 states that “After doing your Computer Science Engineering if you take up jobs as a Programming Analyst, Software Engineer, Hardware Engineer and 
          Associate Engineer you can earn up to 2.5-3 lakhs as a fresh graduate.” Testing this claim in our data.
          Finding there a relationship between gender and specialization? (i.e. Does the preference of Specialisation depend on the Gender?)
Step - 6 - Conclusion
Step - 7 - (Bonus) Coming up with some interesting conclusions or research questions (such as step-5).
